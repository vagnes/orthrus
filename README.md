Orthrus is a HID/keystroke injection device written in CircuitPython, primarily for the Adafruit M4 Airlift Lite.

Scripts are written in OSL (Orthrus Scripting Language) and the following commands are currently available:

| Command                                  | Description                                            |

## Gamepad example buttons scheme (Xbox One)

ABXY: 1,2,3,4

LSB, RSB, LT(float), RT(float): 5,6,7,8

BACK, START: 9,10

LSC, RSC: 11,12

D-Pad, NSEW: 13,14,15,16

## Installation

Simply clone this repository to your Adafruit Metro M4 Airlift Lite and make sure you have the required libraries installed.

### Required libraries

- Adafruit HID
- Neopixel
- Simpleio

## Running

The software should start automatically.

The current configuration is three buttons (at digital pins 2, 3 and 4) which corresponds to routine_a.osl, routine_b.osl and routine_c.osl respectively. In the `config.py` file, you can set `"automatic": true,` which will run the `automatic.osl` script after a few seconds.

## Todo and planned features

- Duckyscript -> OSL
- Add counter in OSL
- Neopixel control with OSL
- OLED screen control
- Wifi enabled control
